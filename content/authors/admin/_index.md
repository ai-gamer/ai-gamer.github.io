I am a third-year PhD student studying Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). My research focuses on reinforcement learing, deep learning and their applications in finance especially quantitative trading. I am the technical lead of an open-source RL for trading platform [TradeMaster](https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU).

`I am actively looking for quant trader & researcher positions anywhere!`
